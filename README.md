# Pretraining BERT with Hugging Face Transformers

This project demonstrates the pretraining of **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks using **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** and **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)** objectives. It also includes the implementation of **data preprocessing**, model architecture building, and **fine-tuning** for downstream tasks like **text classification**.

## Key Features
- **Pretraining** BERT with MLM and NSP objectives.
- **Data preprocessing** using **WordPiece Tokenizer**.
- **Transformer architecture** built with **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- **Fine-tuning** for **text classification** and other **NLP tasks**.
- **Deployment-ready** model for real-world applications.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Hugging Face Transformers (optional for fine-tuning)
- Numpy, Pandas, and other dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bert-pretraining-nlp.git
   cd bert-pretraining-nlp
   
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Tokenize input data using the **WordPiece Tokenizer**.

2. **Pretraining BERT:**
   - Train the BERT model with **MLM** and **NSP** tasks on your dataset.

3. **Fine-Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune the model for tasks like **text classification** by replacing the final layer with task-specific layers.

4. **Model Inference:**
   - Use the trained model for downstream NLP tasks such as **sentiment analysis**, **question answering**, or **named entity recognition**.
